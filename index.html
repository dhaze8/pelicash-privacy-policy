    <h1>Privacy Policy for Pelicash</h1>
    <p class="effective-date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [June 5, 2025]</p>
    <p>Welcome to Pelicash ("we", "us", "our", or "the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the Pelicash mobile application.</p>
    <p>Pelicash is designed to help you find and compare cashback offers and receive notifications about them. <strong>No account registration is required to use Pelicash.</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not directly collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, or physical address, as no account creation is necessary to use the App. However, to provide core functionalities and improve your experience, the App and its integrated third-party services may collect or process certain information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device-Specific Identifier:</strong> We utilize a unique identifier for your device (obtained via a device ID helper mechanism). This identifier is used to:
        <ul>
          <li>Associate your device with your notification preferences and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token, particularly for delivering push notifications.</li>
          <li>Distinguish your alert settings on our backend (Supabase) for iOS users.</li>
        </ul>
        This identifier is not linked to your real-world identity by us.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Token:</strong> If you enable push notifications, a unique token is generated by Firebase Cloud Messaging and stored by us (associated with your device identifier) to send you cashback alerts.</li>
      <li><strong>Notification Preferences:</strong> When you create a cashback alert, we store the details you provide (e.g., store name, cashback category, cashback percentage threshold, peak rate data).
        <ul>
          <li>For <strong>Android users</strong>, this information is stored locally on your device using SharedPreferences.</li>
          <li>For <strong>iOS users</strong>, this information is stored on our secure backend (Supabase), associated with your device identifier, to enable server-side notification checks.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>In-App Purchase Information (RevenueCat):</strong> If you subscribe to Pelicash Premium, our third-party payment processor, RevenueCat, will manage your subscription and process payments. RevenueCat may collect transaction data necessary to facilitate these purchases. We receive anonymized or non-personally identifiable purchase information from RevenueCat to validate subscriptions. We do not directly access or store your sensitive payment card details.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising Data (Google Mobile Ads):</strong> Pelicash may display advertisements through Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). If ads are displayed, Google may collect and use data, such as your device's Advertising ID, IP address, and interaction with ads, to provide personalized advertising. You can typically control personalized advertising through your device's settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data (Limited &amp; Anonymized):</strong> We may collect anonymized and aggregated information about how you interact with the App (e.g., features used, screens visited) to help us improve app performance and user experience. This data does not personally identify you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain App Functionality:</strong> Comparing cashback rates, displaying offers, and enabling you to create and manage cashback alerts.</li>
      <li><strong>To Deliver Notifications:</strong> Sending you push notifications for cashback alerts you have configured (if you have granted permission).</li>
      <li><strong>To Process In-App Purchases:</strong> Facilitating and validating subscriptions to Pelicash Premium through RevenueCat.</li>
      <li><strong>To Display Advertisements:</strong> Showing relevant ads through Google Mobile Ads (if applicable).</li>
      <li><strong>To Improve Our App:</strong> Understanding user behavior through aggregated and anonymized data to enhance features, usability, and performance.</li>
      <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations:</strong> If required by law or valid legal process.</li>
    </ul>
